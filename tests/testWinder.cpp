 * Winder code should be able to compute the winding number of a coordinate with

 * for the Winder class could be std::array<float, 2> or std::vector<double>. It could
 * be pair<float, float>, BezCoord<float> or cv::Point. Let's test a few
 * possibilities. There's some function specialization in morph::Winder which makes
