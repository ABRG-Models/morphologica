# Feedforward neural net

The code in morph/nn/FeedForwardNet.h and ff_mnist.cpp implements a
three layer feed forward neural network (784-30-10 neurons) just like
Michael Niemann's network at
http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com. The network learns to
characterize the well known MNIST database of hand-written numerals,
achieving a 94% success rate.

Build in the usual cmake manner:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
cd ..
./build/ff_mnist # You have to run from one back, so the program can load data from ./mnist/
```
