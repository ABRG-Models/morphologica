# Reference for *Visual classes

This is a section dedicated to the classes that are *derived from*
[`morph::VisualModel`](/morphologica/ref/visual/visualmodel) and can
therefore be included as objects within the scene of a
[`morph::Visual`](/morphologica/ref/visual/visual).

These classes are all called morph::*Something*Visual, where the *Something* refers to the nature of the objects that will be visualized. For example, `morph::QuiverVisual` allows you to visualize vector fields as quiver plots and `morph::GridVisual` is used to visualize data that is arranged on a grid.
