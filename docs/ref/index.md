# morphologica reference

The ultimate reference source for the classes in morphologica is the
headers themselves. In many cases the headers are easy to read because
the code is not split up into header/implementation.

There is also the possibility of generating doxygen reference pages
from the code comments. Although I don't think doxygen-generated
reference material is much easier to learn from than the headers
themselves, they can be built (and may be linked to this site, too, in
future).

*These* reference pages are hand-written and should provide a
quick-to-browse summary of the details of each class.
