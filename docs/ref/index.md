The ultimate reference source for the classes in morphologica is the
headers themselves. In many cases the headers are easy to read because
the code is not split up into header/implementation. However, that's
not always the case.  These reference pages should provide a
quick-to-browse summary of the details of each class without them
being a slavish doxygen-like re-formatting of the information that
already exists in the headers.
