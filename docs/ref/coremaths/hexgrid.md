```c++
#include <morph/HexGrid.h>
```

A hexagonal grid class. This first constructs a regular hexagonal grid in a hexagonal shape, recording neighbour relationships between the elements of the grid. It provides methods for setting the boundary, which may be circular, rectangular or any other shape. The visualization of HexGrids was the original motivation for writing morphologica!
