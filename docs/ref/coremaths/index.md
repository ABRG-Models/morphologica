As I developed the data-vis features of morphologica, I found I needed functionality that I've used repeatedly in many programs.
The most basic was a simple mathematical vector class, [morph::vec](/morphologica/ref/coremaths/vec), which was essential for computing locations within the 3D graphics environment.

As the project progressed, I developed a number of these classes for handling mathematical operations with a convenient interface.
