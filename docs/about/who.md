# Who'd use it?

If you want to write mathematical programs in C++ and you need to *see* the maths, then you need a graphing and visualization library.

If you're a C++ developer and you want to draw runtime graphs, surface plots or scatter plots that are **fast**, you are a member of the target demographic.

If you currently use MATLAB or Python for scientific programming and data visualization, but you want to use C++ for performance, then this library is for you.
