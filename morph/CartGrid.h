     * neighbour relationships correctly.

     * Optionally, a boundary may be set by calling setBoundary (const
     * BezCurvePath&). If this is done, then the boundary is converted to a set of
     * elements, then those elements in the grid lying outside the boundary are removed.

         * rects in recently_seen, and assuming that bhi has had all its adjacent inside
         * rects marked as insideBoundary, find the next boundary rect.
         *
         * \param bhi The boundary rect iterator. From this rect, find the next boundary
         * rect.
         *
         * \param recently_seen a deque containing the recently processed boundary
         * rects. for a boundary which is always exactly one rect thick, you only need a
         * memory of the last boundary rect to keep you going in the right direction
         * around the boundary BUT if your boundary has some "double thickness"
         * sections, then you need to know a few more recent rects to avoid looping
         * around and returning to the start!
         *
         * \param n_recents The number of rects to record in \a recently_seen. The
         * actual number you will need depends on the "thickness" of your boundary -
         * does it have sections that are two rects thick, or sections that are six
         * rects thick? It also depends on the length along which the boundary may be
         * two rects thick. In theory, if you have a boundary section two rects thick
         * for 5 pairs, then you need to store 10 previous rects. However, due to the
         * way that this algorithm tests rects (always testing direction '0' which is
         * East first, then going anti-clockwise to the next direction; North-East and
         * so on), n_recents=2 appears to be sufficient for a thickness 2 boundary,
         * which is what can occur when setting a boundary using the method
         * CartGrid::setEllipticalBoundary. Boundaries that are more than thickness 2
         * shouldn't really occur, whereas a boundary with a short section of thickness
         * 2 can quite easily occur, as in setEllipticalBoundary, where insisting that
         * the boundary was strictly always only 1 rect thick would make that algorithm
         * more complex.
         *
         * \param bdryFlag The flag used to recognise a boundary rect.
         *
         * \param insideFlag The flag used to recognise a rect that is inside the
         * boundary.
         *
