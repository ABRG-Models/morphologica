# Softmats - Deformable body simulator

This simulator uses Position-Based-Dynamics to simulate deformable agents.

The softmats code compiles into a library, and requires the additional dependency glm - on Ubuntu/Debian install *libglm-dev* as well as the usual morphologica dependencies. Note that softmats does not compile by default when morphologic is built; to switch it on, use -DSOFTMATS=ON when calling cmake.
