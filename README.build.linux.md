# Building with morphologica on GNU/Linux

You don't need to *build* morphologica to use the headers, but
you *will* need to install the dependencies.

The cmake-driven morphologica build process compiles a set of test and
example programs which require all of the dependencies to be met.

Programs that ```#include``` morphologica headers will also need to link to
some or all of those dependencies. Finally, you'll need the cmake
program and a C++ compiler which can compile c++-17 code.

## *Required*: Install dependencies

morphologica code depends on OpenGL, Freetype and glfw3. Armadillo and HDF5 are optional dependencies if you use the Bezier curve classes (Armadillo) or the HdfData wrapper class (HDF5).

### Package-managed dependencies for Ubuntu/Debian

To install the visualization dependencies on Ubuntu or Debian Linux:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git \
                 freeglut3-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev \
                 libglfw3-dev libfreetype-dev

```
For the optional dependencies it's:
```sh
sudo apt install libarmadillo-dev libhdf5-dev
```

### Package-managed dependencies for Arch Linux

On Arch Linux, all required dependencies except Armadillo are available in the official repository. They can be installed as follows:

```shell
sudo pacman -S vtk lapack blas freeglut glfw-wayland
# Optional:
sudo pacman -S hdf5
```

**Note:** Specify `glfw-x11` instead of `glfw-wayland` if you use X.org.

Then, optionally, install [Armadillo](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/armadillo/) from AUR.

## *Optional*: Build morphologica

To build the morphologica tests, it's the usual CMake process:

```sh
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/ABRG-Models/morphologica.git
cd morphologica
mkdir build
cd build
# If you have doxygen, you can build the docs with -DBUILD_DOC=1.
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
make -j$(nproc)
# I usually place the morphologica directory inside the code repository I'm working
# on, I call this 'in-tree morphologica', but you can also have the headers in
# /usr/local/include if you install:
sudo make install
```

If you need to build the test programs with a specific compiler, such
as g++-7 or clang, then you just change the cmake call in the recipe
above. It becomes:

```sh
CC=gcc-7 CXX=g++-7 cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
```

### Build the client code

See the top level README for a quick description of how to include morphologica in your client code.

### Tests

To run the test suite, use the `ctest` command in the build directory.

Note that certain test cases will fail if no display server is available (e.g. in Docker images). See also [issue #6](https://github.com/ABRG-Models/morphologica/issues/6).


## Hints for older systems

On **Ubuntu 18.04**, I always installed HDF5, jsoncpp and glfw3 from source, rather than using packaged versions.

On **Ubuntu 16.04**, the packaged cmake is too old, so please manually download and install a recent cmake from https://cmake.org/

morphologica requires a fairly up to date compiler. The one on Ubuntu 16.04 is not supported. Obtain a recent stable gcc (version 7.x, 8.x or 9.x).

If you're on Ubuntu 16.04 (or otherwise find you need GLEW), make sure you have libglew (sudo apt install libglew-dev).
You'll then need to add the switch -DUSE_GLEW=ON when calling cmake.

### Building some of the dependencies manually

Only necessary if the package managed libs don't work.

#### HDF5 library build

You will also need HDF5 installed on your system. There _is_ an HDF5 package for Ubuntu, but I couldn't get the morphologica cmake build process to find it nicely, so I compiled my own version of HDF5 and installed in /usr/local. To do what I did, download HDF5 (https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Downloads), and do a compile and install like this:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
cp path/to/hdf5-1.10.x.tar.gz ./
gunzip hdf5-1.10.x.tar.gz
tar xvf hdf5-1.10.x.tar
cd hdf5-1.10.x
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

#### JSON library build

For the saving and reading of configuration information, you'll need
the jsoncpp library compiled and installed in /usr/local. I cloned it
from github:

```sh
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp.git
cd jsoncpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

This installs jsoncpp as a static library in
/usr/local/lib/libjsoncpp.a which is then linked directly to
libmorphologica by means of the src/CMakeLists.txt file. I'm using the
HEAD of the master branch of the jsoncpp repository, which installs a
library with version about 1.8.4.

#### glfw3 library build

The modern OpenGL code in Visual/HexGridVisual requires the library GLFW3.

It's possible to apt install glfw on recent versions of Ubuntu. Doing so
will install libglfw.a. These build instructions install libglfw3.a (into
/usr/local/lib/).

```
sudo apt install libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
cd glfw
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Docker

A minimal Docker image based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) can be created as follows:

```
cd morphologica/docker/
docker build .
```
