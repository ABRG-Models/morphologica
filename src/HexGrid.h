     * This class is used to build an hexagonal grid of hexagons. The
     * member hexagons are all arranged with a vertex pointing
     * vertically - "point up". The extent of the grid is determined
     * by the x_span set during construction; the number of hexes in
     * the grid by d and x_span.
     *
     * Optionally, a boundary may be set by calling setBoundary (const
     * BezCurvePath&). If this is done, then the boundary is converted
     * to a set of hexes, then those hexes in the hexagonal grid lying
     * outside the boundary are removed.
     *
     * Another option for boundary setting is to pass in a list of
     * Hexes whose positions will be used to mark out the boundary.
     *
     * This class manages the integer iterators stored in each Hex
     * (Hex::vi), which may be used to index into external data
     * structures (arrays or vectors) which contain information about
     * the 2D surface represented by the HexGrid which is to be
     * computed.
